## Adding/removing fields from the database

- Edit `datamodel.graphql` to your heart's content
- run in terminal (make sure you're in the `/server` folder):
```sh
npm run start
```
- Confirm that `generated/schema.graphql` is updated

- Now back in the project root, your mock db should reflect your changes :smile:
